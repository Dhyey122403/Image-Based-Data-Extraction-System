# Image-Based-Data-Extraction-System
Developed a Raspberry Pi 4-based system for automated Inventory Management in industrial settings. Captured product label images and extracted text using PaddleOCR, with RegEx used to parse and categorize entity-based information. Integrated MongoDB for structured storage and efficient querying of extracted product data.
